## G.Hog.Runner

G.Hog.Runner is a fun casual 2D runner made in Unity.  I admittedly was not able to work on this until the last few days of the competition, but I'm quite happy with the end product.  I usually struggle (fail) to finish gameJams in time, and I'm glad I was able to submit a somewhat complete end product this time without sacfiricing my high standards.


## How To Play

Gameplay is very straight forward. You are a groundhog who can switch between summer (upper level)
and fall (lower level) as well as jump in order to avoid obstacles. Controls are as follows:

W - jump
E - swap sides

If you die, just press R to restart. The game increases pace and obstacle density over time for added difficulty.
