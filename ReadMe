Instructions:

Gameplay is very straight forward.  You are a groundhog who can switch between summer (upper level)
and fall (lower level) as well as jump in order to avoid obstacles.  Controls are as follows:

W - jump
E - swap sides

If you die, just press R to restart.  The game increases pace and obstacle density over time for added difficulty.
